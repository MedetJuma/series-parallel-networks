Use "main.cpp" file in order to generate the trees. The size of the tree has to be written in console window.

"sequences for trees.txt" provides the already generated output for n = 9.

Use "main.py" to generate the figures of the trees in ".png" format. The variable "path" defines the ".txt" file generated from "main.cpp" and "dirName" variable defines the directory where the figures must be saved.

"main.py" uses ete3 module to create trees and PIL module to add the comments.

"dlist" provides the total weights of trees of some size. It can be used in Mathematica notebook "tree_weights.nb" for further calculations. The "path" variable defines the pathname of "dlist".

"git_trees" folder contains the trees generated by "main.py" in ".png" format. Trees are sorted based on a class. Each image of the tree also provides the coefficient (the number of possible trees).
