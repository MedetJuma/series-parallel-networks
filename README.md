Use "main.cpp" file in order to generate the trees. The size of the tree has to be written in console window.

"sequences for trees.txt" provides the already generated output for n = 9.

Use "main.py" to generate the figures of the trees in ".png" format. The variable "path" defines the ".txt" file generated from "main.cpp" and "dirName" variable defines the directory where the figures must be saved.
